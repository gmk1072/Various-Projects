Vectors HW- Asteroids

User Funtionality:
	-The user can navigate the main menu and instructions menu
	-The user, when playing the game, can control the ship to destroy the meteors and move around the window.

Design choices:
	I went with a retro style look with the font and graphics.
	I wanted it to kind of feel like space, so I didn't have the ship or the bullets stop moving once they started. 
		You have to manually stop the ship
	I thought of a good, epic feeling instrumental song that could go well with it and chose whoever brings the night by nightwish
	I added as many sound effects that I could add without it, hopefully, feeling too cluttered
	I wanted the game to rather than just limit how many bullets you could shoot at one time always be able to shoot, but only has 
		so many bullets out at one time
	
Above and Beyond:
	I added a menu screen where you can listen to the music, see the instructions and disable the music.
	I added a lot of sound effects to the game for destruction, shooting, click the buttons, music and thrusting forward

Requirements not completed:
	None that I know of

Bugs:
	I could not get one bug that I noticed to be fixed. Sometimes the ship will not register that a key has been released, so it 
		will continue to go in that direction I have trouble recreating it, so I couldn't really test why it was happening.
		I know that it happens sometimes though and that a way to fix it is to press and release the button that it still 
		thinks is pressed.
